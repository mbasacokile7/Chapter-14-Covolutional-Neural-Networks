# Chapter-14-Covolutional-Neural-Networks
Summary of Chapter 14 from the "Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and Tensorflow" book by Geron Aurilien

This chapter goes indepth in Computer Vision techniques that can be used with Tensorflow. 
The notebook some of these techniques, with special attention to Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This sections goes in depth on how these types of networks were formulated and their basic operation. In addition, the following layers are discussed, with code implementations

### Convolution Layers
### Poolings Layers

## Some State of the Art CNN Architectures

A brief discussion of the types of architectures that achieved stellar results in a top tier challenges.

## Using the Pretrained Networks

This section goes in depth on how to use some of these state-of-the-art models.

## Using these models for Transfer Learning

Using these models for tasks that are rtailored for personal projects. This revisits how to implement transfer learning using tensorflow and some of the best practices.

## Object Detection

In this section object detection is broken down into 2 sections. Classifcation which determines if an image has object or not and also Localization: Which determines the position of the object in the image.

NOTE TO SELF: SLOW AND STEADY WINS EVERY TIME
